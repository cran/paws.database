\usage{
rds_delete_db_cluster(
  DBClusterIdentifier,
  SkipFinalSnapshot = NULL,
  FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier = NULL,
  DeleteAutomatedBackups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DBClusterIdentifier}{[required] The DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster to be deleted. This
parameter isn't case-sensitive.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.
}}

\item{SkipFinalSnapshot}{Specifies whether to skip the creation of a final DB cluster snapshot
before RDS deletes the DB cluster. If you set this value to \code{true}, RDS
doesn't create a final DB cluster snapshot. If you set this value to
\code{false} or don't specify it, RDS creates a DB cluster snapshot before it
deletes the DB cluster. By default, this parameter is disabled, so RDS
creates a final DB cluster snapshot.

If \code{SkipFinalSnapshot} is disabled, you must specify a value for the
\code{FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier} parameter.}

\item{FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier}{The DB cluster snapshot identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot
created when \code{SkipFinalSnapshot} is disabled.

If you specify this parameter and also skip the creation of a final DB
cluster snapshot with the \code{SkipFinalShapshot} parameter, the request
results in an error.

Constraints:
\itemize{
\item Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.
\item First character must be a letter
\item Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
}}

\item{DeleteAutomatedBackups}{Specifies whether to remove automated backups immediately after the DB
cluster is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The default is
to remove automated backups immediately after the DB cluster is deleted.}
}
\description{
The DeleteDBCluster action deletes a previously provisioned DB cluster. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the specified DB cluster are not deleted.
